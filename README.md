# Software Licensing Workshop

As researchers, we all use code in our work. Often we will create new scripts or pieces of software, or modify code from someone else. 

This repository contains materials and instructions for running a workshop for researchers and research software engineers focussed on giving them a basic introduction to the software licensing, why it's important, and how to make decisions relating to licensing. It may also be useful for people working in libraries, research data management, research innovation and management at research institutions.

The workshop duration is anticipated to be 1 hour, though material can be scaled to make this shorter or longer.
