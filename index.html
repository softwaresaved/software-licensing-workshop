						<h1>Introduction to Licensing and Intellectual Property</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Licensing and Intellectual Property</h2>
						<p align='left'>Official permission to do something, within limits:</p>
						<ul align='left'>
							<li>You can drink in a pub during their licensed hours</li>
							<li>You can play live music as long as it isn’t above 75db</li>
							<li>You can drive a vehicle up to 3,500kg with up to 8 seats</li>
						</ul>
						<p align='left'>Commonly used to exploit Intellectual Property:</p>
						<ul align='left'>
							<li>You can use my photograph to advertise your product, but only in the United Kingdom</li>
							<li>You can screen this movie in this venue on these dates</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
						<p>Intellectual Property: legal rights (IPRs) from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary and artistic fields</p>
						<p>Patent: Protects ‘new’ ideas and has an ‘inventive step’ that is not obvious to someone who works in the subject area</p>
						<p>Copyright: Protection of a tangible manifestation of an idea; e.g. a book or source/object code</p>
						<p>License: An agreement or permission that grants a right to use - often in the form of a contract</p>
					</section>

						<h1>Why is software licensing important?</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Common Fallacies</h2>
						<h4>"I found it on the internet so I can use it"</h4>
						<p>Publishing in a public place does not automatically grant rights to use.</p>
						<h4>"It’s fine to not have a license"</h4>
						<p>No license worse than a restrictive license.</p>
						<h4>"You automatically own the IP to your creations"</h4>
						<p>Often your employer may own the IP you generate as part of your job. The right license will allow you to exploit it.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Common Use Cases</h2>
						<h4>"I'd like to sell my software commercially"</h4>
						<p>A license allows you to set out the conditions of use.</p>
						<h4>"I want to let others easily reuse my work"</h4>
						<p>A license clearly sets out what people can do, and what you are liable for.</p>
						<h4>"I'd like to set up a company based on software I developed"</h4>
						<p>Choosing the right license will help you exploit your software outside the university.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is a software license?</h2>
						<p align='left'>A legal instrument governs the permission you are granting to others to use or distribute the software you hold the copyright on:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Are you allowed to use it?</li>
							<li>Are you allowed to copy it?</li>
							<li>Are you allowed to resell it?</li>
							<li>Are you allowed to change it?</li>
							<li>Are you allowed to distribute it?</li>
							<li>Who is liable if something goes wrong?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h1>Choosing a license isn't hard, but we think it is</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Types of License</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Closed ("Proprietary")</li>
							<li>Restricted ("Academic" / "Non-commercial")</li>
							<li>Open ("Open Source")</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Copyleft ("Share modifications under same license")</li>
									<li>Permissive ("Use with Attribution")</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Public Domain / CC0</li>
							<li>Informal</li>
							<li>No license</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Question:</h1>
						<h2>What do you want people to do with your software?</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Key Considerations</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Does your software depend on other software?</li>
							<li>What type of impact are you seeking?</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Widespread usage</li>
								<li>Commercial revenue</li>
								<li>Research outcomes</li>
								<li>Social or cultural change</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Do you care whether changes made by other people are made available?</li>
							<li>Do you care if certain people / organisations use your software?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Larger works comprising code with different licenses (“license compatibility”)</li>
							<li>Software made available under more than one license (“dual licensing”)</li>
							<li>Copyright holders can re-license as they own the IP (“relicensing”)</li>
							<li>Projects with multi contributors from different organisations ("contributor agreements")</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
							<h2>How do I <i>actually</i> license my software?</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Choose a license <i>(more on this soon)</i></li>
								<li>Put the license text in a file called LICENSE.TXT or LICENSE.md in the root directory of your source code repository <i>(you are using version control, right?)</i></li>
								<li>Include information about your chosen license in your README <i>(and website and documentation if you have them)</i></li>
								<li>(Optionally) Add copyright and licensing information to your source code files <i>(there are tools to help)</i></li>
							</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>General Tips</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>If using a commercial license, get it checked by a lawyer</li>
							<li>If using an open source license, use a <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">popular OSI-approved one</a></li>
							<li>If thinking about using an academic / non-commercial license, think about what you'd like to achieve and consider dual-licensing</li>
							<li>If thinking about putting into public domain, consider using a permissive open source license or CC0 instead.</li>
							<li>Don't ever think about writing your own license from scratch!</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Pros and Cons of Open Source</h2>
  					<div style="text-align: left; float: left; width: 45%;">
							<p>Pros</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Easier to evaluate</li>
								<li>No lock-in</li>
								<li>Easier to attract contributors and staff</li>
								<li>Frictionless code sharing</li>
								<li>Free advertising</li>
								<li>Able to take with you</li>
								<li>Reduced duplication</li>
								<li>Can work together on common platforms</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div style="text-align: left; float: right; width: 45%;">
							<p>Cons</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Harder to corner cut <!--when shipping to deadline--></li>
								<li>Harder to gain income from <i>directly</i> selling the software</li>
								<li>Cannot restrict to non-commercial use only</li>
								<li>Once licensed, cannot revoke license <!--(Though can relicense)--></li>
								<li>Can increase competition</li>
							</ul>
  					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Copyleft vs Permissive</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Software freedom vs developer freedom</li>
							<li>Copyleft licenses have increased license management costs</li>
							<li>Industry is generally more supportive of permissive licenses</li>
							<li>Open source software no longer written as an alternative to closed, but as the platform to drive service provision</li>
							<li>Software no longer the competitive differentiator, but the ability to operate it at scale is</li>

						<h1>Common Licensing Scenarios</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>"I want a simple license that lets everyone use my code"</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>For a really simple license, consider the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license">MIT license</a></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Easy for anyone to reuse software: can do anything but must provide attribution and can't hold you liable</li>
								<li>However software can be redistributed under different terms and modifications don't have to be shared</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Don't want people using your (or your organisation's) name to promote products or services based on the code? Consider the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-3-clause-license-%28revised%29">BSD 3-Clause license</a></li>
							<li>Concerned about patent right grants? Consider the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-%28apache-2.0%29">Apache License 2.0</a></li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>"I want any improvements to the code to be shared"</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>If you want all changes to be shared, consider the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-%28gpl-3%29">GNU GPLv3 license</a></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Anyone who distributes, modifies or creates a derivative work from your software must make the source code available under the <i>same</i> terms</li>
								<li>Provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Want to make it easier for people to "productise" your code? Consider the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-lesser-general-public-license-v3-%28lgpl-3%29">GNU Lesser GPL v3 License</a></li>
							<li>Want internal deployment or software-as-a-service changes to be shared? Consider the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-%28agpl-3.0%29">GNU Affero GPL v3 License</a></li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>"I want to make money"</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>You can commercially exploit software released under closed, restricted and open licenses.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Proprietary License: traditional "shrink wrap" software approach</li>
								<li>Permissive Platforms: platform released under permissive license, encouraging development of an ecosystem of related tools, e.g. OpenStack
								<li>Dual-licensing: distributed under copyleft license but also available under commercial license, e.g. MongoDB</li>
								<li>Dual-edition: open source community edition, closed source enhanced edition, e.g. SugarCRM</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What does "express grant of patent rights mean"?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Releasing code which embodies a patent may be granting rights to use the patent to anyone who chooses to use it - even if the license does not explicitly say so</li>
							<li>Licenses such as the Apache License V2.0 and GNU GPL v3 include specific clauses for:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>patent grants: explicitly grant patent rights necessary to use, adapt and distribute the software</li>
								<li>patent retaliation: anyone bringing legal action alleging the software embodies their software patents loses the licence you have granted to copy, use, adapt and distribute the software</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						<h1>Licensing vs Governance</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Governance is...</h2>
						<h3>...the thing that stops a project from descending into chaos</h3>
						<p>Ground rules for decision making, participation, communication and sharing.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Open source vs Open development</h2>
						<p align='left'>Open source software philosophy is more than the license</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Some open licensed software is not produced openly</li>
							<li>Some closed licensed software benefits from open source project principles and processes</li>
							<li>Many open source contributors are paid (in some way) to do so</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Best practice for software projects</h2>
						<p align='left'>Best practice identified from OSS projects useful for managing all types of software projects/products</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://producingoss.com">Producing OSS by Karl Fogel</a>: open forums, websites, transparent decision making, releasing software well, open about status</li>
						</ul>
						<p><i>Open source licensed software != Open development</i></p>
						<p><i>Can use open development practices in closed source projects</i></p>

						<h1>Takeaways</h1>
						<ol>
							<li>Work out impact you'd like your software to have</li>
							<li>Choose a license, mindfully, and apply it</li>

						<h2>Science as an Open Enterprise</h2>
						<p>"Publishing data in a reusable form to support findings must be mandatory"</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>RCUK committed to openness</h2>
						<p>“As bodies charged with investing public money in research, the Research Councils take very seriously their responsibilities in making the outputs from this research publicly available – not just to other researchers, but also to potential users in business, charitable and public sectors, and to the general tax‐paying public.”
- http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/openaccess/</p>
						<p>“Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property.” - http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/datapolicy/
</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What about software?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Depends on research being carried out</li>
							<li>Deciding factor is whether the software is necessary to validate research findings</li>
							<li>Even if you don’t need to preserve software, it’s good practice to make available to enable access, validation, and reuse of your results</li>
							<li>And sometimes it’s easier to store the code than the results</li>
							<li>Does not prevent commercialisation and exploitation of software, but you should make a case for why you are not open-sourcing code</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Expectations around software</h2>
						<p align='left'>Research organisations are not expected to assume responsibility for software not produced within their own organisation</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Prudent to take reasonable steps to assure the continued availability of the software you use</li>
							<li>Preserving copy of open-source software</li>
							<li>Use commercial software where a multi-year support agreement is available</li>
							<li>Use open-data formats</li>
						</ul>
						<p align='left'>Not all software must be shared, if there are ethical, legal or commercial reasons</p>

						<h2>Notes on license compatibility</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>An arrow from box A to box B means that you can combine software with these licenses; the combined result effectively has the license of B, possibly with additions from A.</li>
							<li>Strict GNU Public License v2 (no "or later" clause) cannot be combined with GPLv3 or LGPLv3</li>
