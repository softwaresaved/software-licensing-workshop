						<h2>Licensing and Intellectual Property</h2>
						<p align='left'>Official permission to do something, within limits:</p>
						<ul align='left'>
							<li>You can drink in a pub during their licensed hours</li>
							<li>You can play live music as long as it isn’t above 75db</li>
							<li>You can drive a vehicle up to 3,500kg with up to 8 seats</li>
						</ul>
						<p align='left'>Commonly used to exploit Intellectual Property:</p>
						<ul align='left'>
							<li>You can use my photograph to advertise your product, but only in the United Kingdom</li>
							<li>You can screen this movie in this venue on these dates</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
						<p>Intellectual Property: legal rights (IPRs) from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary and artistic fields</p>
						<p>Patent: Protects ‘new’ ideas and has an ‘inventive step’ that is not obvious to someone who works in the subject area</p>
						<p>Copyright: Protection of a tangible manifestation of an idea; e.g. a book or source/object code</p>
						<p>License: An agreement or permission that grants a right to use - often in the form of a contract</p>

						<h1>Why is software licensing important?</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Common Fallacies</h2>
						<h4>"I found it on the internet so I can use it"</h4>
						<p>Publishing in a public place does not automatically grant rights to use.</p>
						<h4>"It’s fine to not have a license"</h4>
						<p>No license worse than a restrictive license.</p>
						<h4>"You automatically own the IP to your creations"</h4>
						<p>Often your employer may own the IP you generate as part of your job. The right license will allow you to exploit it.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is a software license?</h2>
						<p align='left'>A legal instrument governs the permission you are granting to others to use or distribute the software you hold the copyright on:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Are you allowed to use it?</li>
							<li>Are you allowed to copy it?</li>
							<li>Are you allowed to resell it?</li>
							<li>Are you allowed to change it?</li>
							<li>Are you allowed to distribute it?</li>
							<li>Who is liable if something goes wrong?</li>
						</ul>

						<h1>Choosing a license isn't hard, but we think it is</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Types of License</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Closed ("Proprietary")</li>
							<li>Restricted ("Academic" / "Non-commercial")</li>
							<li>Open ("Open Source")</li>
							<li>Public Domain / CC0</li>
							<li>Informal</li>
							<li>No license</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What do you want people to do with your software?</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Larger works comprising code with different licenses (“license compatibility”)</li>
							<li>Software made available under more than one license (“dual licensing”)</li>
							<li>Copyright holders can re-license as they own the IP (“relicensing”)</li>
						</ul>

						<h1>Licensing vs Governance</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Governance is...</h2>
						<h3>...the thing that stops a project from descending into chaos</h3>
						<p>Ground rules for decision making, participation, communication and sharing.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Open source vs Open development</h2>
						<p align='left'>Open source software philosophy is more than the license</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Some open licensed software is not produced openly</li>
							<li>Some closed licensed software benefits from open source project principles and processes</li>
							<li>Many open source contributors are paid (in some way) to do so</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Best practice for software projects</h2>
						<p align='left'>Best practice identified from OSS projects useful for managing all types of software projects/products</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://producingoss.com">Producing OSS by Karl Fogel</a>: open forums, websites, transparent decision making, releasing software well, open about status</li>
						</ul>
						<p><i>Open source licensed software != Open development</i></p>
						<p><i>Can use open development practices in closed source projects</i></p>

						<h1>Expectations from Research Funders</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Science as an Open Enterprise</h2>
						<p>"Publishing data in a reusable form to support findings must be mandatory"</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>RCUK committed to openness</h2>
						<p>“As bodies charged with investing public money in research, the Research Councils take very seriously their responsibilities in making the outputs from this research publicly available – not just to other researchers, but also to potential users in business, charitable and public sectors, and to the general tax‐paying public.”
- http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/openaccess/</p>
						<p>“Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property.” - http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/datapolicy/
</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What about software?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Depends on research being carried out</li>
							<li>Deciding factor is whether the software is necessary to validate research findings</li>
							<li>Even if you don’t need to preserve software, it’s good practice to make available to enable access, validation, and reuse of your results</li>
							<li>And sometimes it’s easier to store the code than the results</li>
							<li>Does not prevent commercialisation and exploitation of software, but you should make a case for why you are not open-sourcing code</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Expectations around software</h2>
						<p align='left'>Research organisations are not expected to assume responsibility for software not produced within their own organisation</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Prudent to take reasonable steps to assure the continued availability of the software you use</li>
							<li>Preserving copy of open-source software</li>
							<li>Use commercial software where a multi-year support agreement is available</li>
							<li>Use open-data formats</li>
						</ul>
						<p align='left'>Not all software must be shared, if there are ethical, legal or commercial reasons</p>

						<h2>License Compatibility</h2>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Notes on license compatibility</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>An arrow from box A to box B means that you can combine software with these licenses; the combined result effectively has the license of B, possibly with additions from A.</li>
							<li>Strict GNU Public License v2 (no "or later" clause) cannot be combined with GPLv3 or LGPLv3</li>
							<li>MPL is incompatible with GPL licenses</li>
